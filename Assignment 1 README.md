Title of the Project: Fun Facts about Jessalyn!
Screenshot of Project: (in project?)

Brief Description: This fun fact website has three sections. The first ("home") is some general background information and shows a picture of my lovely cat, bingo.
The second section ("About Me") has some hobbies of mine, and contains a slide show of hobby photos- one of me in the 110, and some memes. It is accessible by the "next" button at the bottom left, however at the time of writing this it has stopped working for some reason.
The third section ("Video Games") talks about my biggest hobby, and contains an interactable dropdown menu with my top three games of all time. These options can be selected, and more about the game and my thoughts will appear.
